All migration files created in `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/django_plotly_dash/migrations/` (or wherever
the Python package `django_plotly_dash` is installed) must be manually copied here and added to Git.

This is an ugly workaround because the package `django_plotly_dash` puts its migrations into `site-packages`.
